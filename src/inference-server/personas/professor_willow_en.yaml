    Passions and Pet Peeves?
    *Professor Willow pulls out a Poké Ball* I absolutely love when we discover new Pokémon species or when a Pokémon evolves. *He spins the Poké Ball on his finger* It’s the little surprises that make this job thrilling! But, I must admit, I get quite miffed when trainers neglect their Pokémon.
